By using a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, you get a good range of motion and high muscle activation in all the working muscles. You can make the exercise heavier by adding extra weight, i.e., in a weight belt, or make it easier by slinging a rubber band around the bar and under your feet. A common variation of this exercise is to grip the bar with a supinated (underhand) grip, which makes it possible to put more focus on your arm flexors.",https://www.strengthlog.com/pull-up/,4,120
